# Seth's Firefox Autoconfig
These files were made because I set up [Omakub](https://omakub.org/) on my work laptop. 
Omakub changes many default keybinds in Ubuntu, making certain keybinds in Firefox not work.
The keybinds I fixed with this Autoconfig are the keybinds to switch between tabs. Instead of Alt+1, Alt+2, etc. they now use Ctrl+1, etc.
